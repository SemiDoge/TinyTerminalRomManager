## **Disclaimer**
TinyTerminalRomManger is a software application designed to help users organize and manage emulators and ROMs. It does not distribute or provide access to any copyrighted material, including ROMs, game files, or any other copyrighted content.

## Dependencies
* Linux
* ncurses
* fmt
* yaml-cpp
* cxxopts
* spdlog

## Limitations

TTRM doesn't play well with more than one emulator whose ROMs use the file extension `.iso`. As it uses the file extension to determine which emulator to invoke.

## Getting Started

### Usage
```console
Usage:
  ttrm [OPTION...]

  -i, --index arg  INDEX Rom directory
  -d, --depth arg  Index recursion MAX DEPTH, default = 3
  -v, --version    PRINT program version
  -h, --help       PRINT help text
```

TinyTerminalRomManager requires a emulator configuration file to exist in the folder `~/.config/TinyTermRomManager/emus.yaml`.

### Workflow
* Set up a directory with ROMs
* Create a emulator configuration file
  * Follow the sample below to guide you in creating this file
  * Save the file to `~/.config/TinyTermRomManager/emus.yaml`
* Run ttrm with the `-i` switch and point it to that directory
  * Example: `ttrm -i~/Roms/` or ttrm `--index=~/Roms/`
* If it was successful it will tell you which directories it indexed and how many ROMs it detected.
* Then you are all set! Just run ttrm without a switch and it will display the ROM menu.


### `emus.yaml` sample

``` yaml
- name: mgba
  extension: # [array] extensions to associate 
  - gba
  - gbc
  - gb
  type: Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Color, Gameboy # optional, for organizational purposes
  path: /usr/bin/mgba-qt # path to emulator
  args: # [array] any special arguments to call w/ the emulator

  ... # ttrm allows for multiple emulators to be specified in this file.
```

#### **Important**: `args`
The `args` array expects one of its entries to contain the exact string `"${FILENAME}"`. This is so it knows where to put the filename of the ROM when invoking the emulator with the supplied `args`.


### `roms.yaml`

This file is automatically generated when using the index functionality. It keeps track of the ROMs and the emulator assigned to run them. After indexing for the first time the file can be found in `~/.config/TinyTermRomManager/roms.yaml`.

## User Interaction and Navigation
### Up & Down
* The `UP` & `DOWN` arrow keys.
* Mouse scroll wheel `UP` or `DOWN`. *(Linux only)*

### Jump Up & Down
* `CTRL+U` and `CTRL+D` to jump up or jump down 15 menu options, respectively.

### Search Function
* Press either `CTRL+F` or `/` to enter ttrm's search mode. 
* Start typing your search term and the menu will update with search results displaying the ROMs that best fit your search.
* Once you have found the ROM you want to play, press `ENTER` to enter the selection mode.
* Once in selection mode 

### Closing the program
* As long as you are not in Search mode pressing `'q'` on the keyboard will close the program.
    * If you are in Search mode, press `ENTER` and then you will be able to use the `'q'` key to close ttrm.
